<p>We don`t talk anymore</p>


<p>
    We don't talk anymore <br>
    We don't talk anymore  <br>
    We don't talk anymore <br>
    Like we used to do  <br>
    We don't love anymore <br>
    What was all of it for?  <br>
    Oh, we don't talk anymore  <br>
    Like we used to do...  <br>
    <br>
    I just heard you found the one you've been looking <br>
    You've been looking for  <br>
    I wish I would have known that wasn't me <br>
    Cause even after all this time I still wonder <br>
    Why I can't move on  <br>
    Just the way you did so easily  <br>
   <br><br>
    Don't wanna know
    What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
    If he's holding onto you so tight
    The way I did before

    <br><br>
    I overdosed
    Should've known your love was a game
    Now I can't get you out of my brain
    Oh, it's such a shame
    <br><br>
    That we don't talk anymore
    We don't talk anymore
    We don't talk anymore
    Like we used to do
    We don't love anymore
    What was all of it for?
    Oh, we don't talk anymore
    Like we used to do
    <br><br>
    [Selena Gomez]
    I just hope you're lying next to somebody
    Who knows how to love you like me
    There must be a good reason that you're gone
    Every now and then I think you
    Might want me to come show up at your door
    But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
    <br><br>
    Don't wanna know
    If you're looking into her eyes
    If she's holding onto you so tight
    The way I did before
    I overdosed
    Should've known your love was a game
    Now I can't get you out of my brain
    Oh, it's such a shame
    <br><br>
    That we don't talk anymore
    (We don't we don't)
    We don't talk anymore
    (We don't we don't)
    We don't talk anymore
    Like we used to do
    <br><br>
    We don't love anymore
    (We don't we don't)
    What was all of it for?
    (We don't we don't)
    Oh, we don't talk anymore
    Like we used to do
    <br><br>
    (Like we used to do)
    <br><br>
    Don't wanna know
    What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
    If he's giving it to you just right
    The way I did before
    I overdosed
    Should've known your love was a game
    Now I can't get you out of my brain
    Oh, it's such a shame
    <br><br>
    That we don't talk anymore
    (We don't we don't)
    We don't talk anymore
    (We don't we don't)
    We don't talk anymore
    Like we used to do
    <br><br>
    We don't love anymore
    (We don't we don't)
    What was all of it for?
    (We don't we don't)
    Oh, we don't talk anymore
    Like we used to do
    <br><br>
    (We don't talk anymore)
    Don't wanna know
    What kind of dress you're wearing tonight (Oh)
    If he's holding onto you so tight (Oh)
    The way I did before
    <br><br>
    (We don't talk anymore)
    I overdosed
    Should've known your love was a game (Oh)

<p>love the way you lie</p>

<ol>

    <li>just gonna stand there and watch me burn
        Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
        Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
        Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie
        I love the way you lie
        I can't tell you what it really is
        I can only tell you what it feels like
        And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
        I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
        As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
        High off of love drunk from my hate
        It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer
        I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
        She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me
        And I love it, wait
        Where you going? I'm leaving you
        No you ain't, come back
        We're running right back, here we go again
        It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
        I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
        But when it's bad, it's awful
        I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude?
        I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
        I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength
        Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
        Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
        Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
        Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie
        I love the way you lie
        I love the way you lie
        You ever love somebody so much
        You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
        And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
        Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
        Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
        You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
        Now you're in each other's face,
        Spewing venom in your words, when you spit 'em
        You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
        Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
        It's the rage that took over it controls you both
        So they say it's best, to go your separate ways
        Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
        Yesterday is over, it's a different day
        Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
        Next time you'll show restraint
        You don't get another chance
        Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
        Now you get to watch her leave
        Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane
        Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
        But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
        Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
        But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
        I love the way you lie
        I love the way you lie
        Now I know we said things, did things
        That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
        Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
        You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
        Baby please come back, it wasn't you
        Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
        Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
        All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
        Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
        Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk?
        Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
        Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
        Next time, there will be no next time
        I apologize even though I know it's lies
        I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
        If she ever tries to fucking leave again
        I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
        Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
        But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
        Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
        But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
        I love the way you lie
        I love the way you lie
